            "feedback": {
              "Stronger": "That's right! When other countries adopt American standards and prefer U.S. approaches, it reinforces America's global leadership and influence. The key phrase here is 'setting the U.S. as the global standard' — that's about positioning and strength on the world stage.",
              "Safer": "Not quite. While global influence can indirectly support security, this statement is really about America's leadership position — other countries choosing U.S. tech and training as the standard. That's about influence and strength, not safety. The correct answer is Stronger.",
              "More Prosperous": "Close, but not quite. Tech and training adoption could eventually create economic benefits, but the emphasis here is on the U.S. being seen as the global standard — that's about leadership and influence, not direct economic returns. The correct answer is Stronger."

            "feedback": {
              "More Prosperous": "Exactly! The dollar signs are a strong signal here. $2.8 billion in partnerships and 45,000 U.S. jobs are direct economic outcomes. Whenever you see revenue, jobs, or investment figures, think More Prosperous.",
              "Safer": "Not this one. There's no security or stability angle in this statement — it's all about money and jobs. $2.8B in partnerships and 45K jobs are economic indicators, which map to More Prosperous.",
              "Stronger": "Good instinct — collaboration does strengthen relationships. But the statement leads with $2.8B and 45K jobs, which are concrete economic outcomes. When the headline numbers are dollars and jobs, that's More Prosperous."

              "Stronger": "Correct! 'Enhancing transatlantic ties' and building partnerships between leaders is about deepening alliances and strengthening America's global relationships. That's the core of what Stronger means in this framework.",
              "Safer": "Transatlantic ties do contribute to a more stable world, but this statement is focused on relationship-building between business leaders — that's about alliance strength and influence, not security. The correct answer is Stronger.",
              "More Prosperous": "Business leaders are involved, so the economic angle is tempting. But the statement emphasizes 'ties' and 'partnerships' as relationship outcomes, not financial ones. No dollar figures, no jobs — this is about strengthening alliances. The correct answer is Stronger."

              "Safer": "Spot on! 'Reducing the appeal of violent extremism' is a clear security outcome. Pro-democracy networks and civic resilience also contribute to global stability, which directly makes America safer.",
              "Stronger": "Pro-democracy networks do strengthen institutions, but the clincher here is 'reducing the appeal of violent extremism.' That's explicitly about security and safety. When you see language about countering threats or extremism, think Safer.",
              "More Prosperous": "This one has no economic indicators at all — no dollars, jobs, or trade. It's focused on democracy, civic resilience, and countering extremism, all of which are security outcomes. The correct answer is Safer."

              "Safer": "Right! Two safety signals here: 'stabilized regions' and 'reducing migration pressures on U.S. borders.' Both are about security and stability — stabilization abroad reduces risks at home.",
              "Stronger": "Stabilization might feel like making America 'stronger,' but look at the second half: 'reducing migration pressures on U.S. borders.' That's a direct homeland security framing. Regional stability plus border security equals Safer.",
              "More Prosperous": "Education and training can have economic benefits, but this statement doesn't mention any. It's focused on stabilizing regions and reducing border pressures — both security outcomes. The correct answer is Safer."

              "More Prosperous": "Nailed it! $780M in revenue and 3,200 new companies are textbook economic outcomes. This is as clear-cut as More Prosperous gets — direct financial returns flowing back to the U.S.",
              "Safer": "There's nothing in this statement related to security or stability. It's all about money coming into universities and companies being created. Both are economic outcomes, so the correct answer is More Prosperous.",
              "Stronger": "International education does build soft power and influence, but this statement is quantifying the financial return — $780M and 3,200 companies. When the data points are economic, go with More Prosperous."

              "Stronger": "Exactly right! When foreign firms adopt American standards as their model, that's U.S. influence expanding globally. Standard-setting is one of the clearest forms of global strength and leadership.",
              "Safer": "Regulatory standards might sound like they relate to safety, but this is about U.S. business practices being adopted as the global model. That's influence and leadership, not security. The correct answer is Stronger.",
              "More Prosperous": "Adopting U.S. business standards could eventually make trade easier, but the statement emphasizes the adoption itself — 78% of firms looking to America as the model. That's about influence and standard-setting, which is Stronger."

              "non_framed": "This one's actually mid-tier. It reads softly, but words like 'leadership,' 'innovation,' and 'opportunity' are doing quiet strategic work — they frame exchange as purposeful, not just a personal experience. And 'global partners' positions the U.S. as a player on the world stage. It's subtle, but it's there.",
              "mid": "Good call — this sits in the middle. It's not pushing an America-first angle, but 'leadership,' 'innovation,' and 'opportunity' nudge it above purely neutral. 'Global partners' also adds a diplomatic tone that you wouldn't find in unframed personal storytelling.",
              "framed": "This one's actually mid-tier, not heavily framed. While 'leadership' and 'innovation' have a strategic flavor, the tone stays collaborative — 'trust,' 'understanding,' 'between the U.S. and global partners.' Compare it to statements that say 'defend U.S. interests' or 'national resilience' — that's what heavy framing sounds like."

No strategy, no national interest, no policy language. This is what exchange messaging sounds like before any framing is applied.",
              "mid": "This one's actually non-framed. 'Inspired to make a difference' might sound purposeful, but the whole statement stays at the personal level — cultures, friends, communities. There's no hint of U.S. interests, competitiveness, or strategic goals. That's what keeps it at the bottom of the scale.",
              "framed": "This is about as unframed as it gets. There's no strategic language anywhere — 'new cultures,' 'lifelong friends,' 'make a difference in their communities' is entirely personal storytelling. When you see language like this with no mention of national interests or policy outcomes, that's your signal it's non-framed."

It feels balanced because of words like 'shared' and 'cooperation,' but 'leaders, educators, and innovators' elevates the audience beyond personal stories, and 'prosperity and progress' are policy-level words. It's making a case — just a collaborative one.",
              "mid": "Good read — this is solidly mid-tier. 'Shared prosperity and progress' introduces a policy angle, and 'leaders, educators, and innovators' elevates the tone. But 'cooperation' and 'shared' keep it framed as mutual benefit rather than American advantage. That balance is what makes it mid-tier.",
              "framed": "This one's actually mid-tier. 'Prosperity and progress' sound strategic, but notice 'shared' and 'cooperation' — the message consistently frames exchange as two-way, not America-first.

Look at what's packed in here: 'competitive workforce' treats people as strategic assets, 'defend U.S. interests' is explicitly America-first, and 'national resilience' is security language. Even the opening word 'investing' frames exchange as a return on investment for the U.S., not a mutual benefit.",
              "mid": "This actually lands in the framed tier. 'Competitive workforce' and 'national resilience' are doing heavy lifting, and 'defend U.S. interests' is about as direct as America-first language gets. Mid-tier statements talk about cooperation and shared benefit — this one is squarely about what the U.S. gets out of it.",
              "framed": "Spot on — this is clearly in the framed tier. 'Competitive workforce,' 'defend U.S. interests,' 'national resilience' — every major phrase positions exchange as a tool for American strategic advantage. The word 'investing' at the start seals it, framing the whole thing as an ROI argument for the U.S."

This is what purely non-framed exchange messaging looks like.",
